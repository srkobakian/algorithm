Thank you for submitting your "A Hexagon A Hexagon Tile Map Algorithm for Displaying Spatial Data" to the R Journal. The reviews request major revisions as described below.

Please note that I am including 1-review-4.txt. I donâ€™t believe it was a particularly constructive review and the reviewer will not be included in the next round of revision. However, I am including in case it helps you identify areas to strengthen your manuscript.

We would appreciate a revised version and point-by-point response to the reviewers comments within 2 months. Remember, that when responding to the reviewer's comments, your job is to persuade me, the editor, that either you've dealt with the issue, or that it's not relevant. To this end, please produce a single document that includes all the reviewers comments mingled with your responses. I particularly recommend the strategy described at http://matt.might.net/articles/peer-review-rebuttals/.

When you have your revised article ready, please submit a zip containing all relevant files through the article submission at https://journal.r-project.org/submissions.html. You will need to include the article id listed in the Subject line into the form.
