
I can't execute the code; there are several missing resources. So I can't test 
the code or replicate the examples.  In general, the paper shows an algorithm 
that has been tested only on Australian data.

The algorithm is written plainly without any mathematical or geometrical 
approach (in an academic sense). It seems more a Medium article than a 
scientific paper.  I can't understand the main differences with a classical 
density plot for spatial data.  For these reasons, I recommend rejecting the 
paper.
